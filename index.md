A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”

##Difference Between TextEditors and IDEs
*A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

#**Opening a Terminal

*If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.

*If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.

*If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is putty
